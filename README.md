# Adel's Tiny "Projects"

When not working on a project, I may sometimes learn things here and there. In those situations, I may want to apply some of my learnings right away, or I may want to solve something that had stumped me before.

In comes this repo: a small catalog of things I am learningâ€”be it about a Python library, a C/C++ structure outside of my learning syllabus, a weird function that fits a niche need, or a problem that I thought of while showering or having lunch/dinner/a few chats.

For anyone stumbling on this repo: if you know of a more "optimal" way and don't mind taking the time to teach me about it, by all means do so. I'm at the stage where all nits are useful.
